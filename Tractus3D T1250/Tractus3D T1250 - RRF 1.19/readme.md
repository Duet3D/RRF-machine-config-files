# Tractus3D T1250 config files

These are the original config files that came with a Tractus3D T1250 3D printer, purchased in March 2025. 

Electronics is Duet 2 Ethernet (v1.02) running RepRapFirmware 1.19. Files mostly date from August 2017, but config.g was updated in 2023. I can't see much change between the files apart from Ethernet address, so I assume it is mostly as originally supplied.

Gcodes and www folders have been omitted.
